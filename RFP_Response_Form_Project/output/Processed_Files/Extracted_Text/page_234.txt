the responses for evaluation purposes. In order to receive full consideration, offerors
are encouraged to ensure that the information provided within their proposal is factual,
accurate and complete.

The offeror’s proposal must include all data and information required by this Section L
and must be submitted in accordance with these instructions. The proposal shall be
prepared and submitted in form and content in accordance with the instructions herein.
Offerors are hereby on notice that a failure to submit all the required documentation in
exactly the manner (timeliness and format) specified in the solicitation may constitute a
basis for the Government to reject a proposal as non-compliant and therefore,
unawardable, at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer. The Government
reserves the right to waive minor informalities, non-compliances and irregularities in
proposals without holding exchanges with Offerors.

The proposal shall be clear and concise and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation
and for substantiating the validity of stated claims. The proposal shall not simply restate or
rephrase the Government’s requirements, but rather provide a convincing rationale explaining
how the offeror intends to meet these requirements.

Offerors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their facilities and
experience, and that it will base its evaluation exclusively on the merits and content of the
information presented in the offeror’s proposal. Each volume shall be written on a stand- alone
basis so that its contents may be evaluated without cross-referencing.

The offeror is responsible for providing adequate documentation to enable a thorough evaluation
of the proposal. The offeror shall submit a proposal that clearly and concisely describes and
defines the offeror’s response to the objectives/requirements contained in the RFP. Unnecessary
elaboration or other presentations beyond what 1s sufficient to present a complete and effective
proposal are not desired. Elaborate artwork, expensive paper, or bindings, and expensive visual
or other presentation aids are neither necessary nor desired. Hasty responses or responses which
merely repeat the Statement of Work (SOW) cannot be considered as being responsive to the
requirements of this RFP. Assurances of experience, capability, or qualifications, without a clear
demonstration to support this claim, will adversely influence the evaluation of the proposal. The
proposal shall contain all the pertinent information in sufficient detail in the area of the proposal
where it contributes most critically to the discussion of the same information. When necessary,
the offeror shall refer to the initial discussion and identify its location within the proposal.

If an offeror does not understand the instructions contained herein, written notification should be
provided to the Contracting Officer for clarification 10 days prior to the deadline for the receipt
of proposals to get an answer in time to meet the deadline. The Government will publish the
questions asked and the answers given and distribute them to all prospective offerors.

Alternate proposals are not authorized. Exceptions to any terms and conditions of the RFP may
make the proposal unacceptable. Moreover, proposals must respond to all requirements of the
solicitation with no additions or deletions. Non-conformance with the solicitation requirements
shall render the offer unacceptable and the Offeror may be deemed ineligible foraward, at the
