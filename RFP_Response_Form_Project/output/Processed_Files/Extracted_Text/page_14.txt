C.3 SCOPE

JETS Contractors shall provide the full range of IT services, technical and management expertise
that support applications, software, hardware, infrastructure, systems, and research and
development across the DLA IT Enterprise. Support will be provided for information
technology solutions, technical support, maintenance, and sustainment; operations support;
application development, maintenance, and technical support; and lifecycle management. This
acquisition also supports administrative program management support for IT program offices
and the DLA Information Operations (J6) Office. Additionally, this contract will support the
DLA Information Technology R&D program which executes programs and projects for all of
DLA participating in programs in the Defense Industrial Base Manufacturing and Small Business
Innovation Research. To ensure support for the entire DLA R&D Program, a broad range of
scientific, technical, and engineering disciplines are needed to support the established programs.
While JETS will primarily support DLA IT services requirements, the resultant contracts will
also allow for de-centralized ordering by other DoD agencies.

While this SOW identifies the general service areas, the suite of resulting contracts and
subsequent task orders are intended to satisfy the full range of IT-related requirements within
these areas of services. With the pace of technology change, it is difficult to anticipate how the
Governmentâ€™s IT requirements and individual programs will evolve over the life of these
contracts.

All Task Orders (TOs) issued off the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s)
will be performance-based acquisitions utilizing a Performance Work Statement (PWS).

Following the award of the IDIQ contracts, the specific scope of each effort will be based on the
specific tasks to be set forth 1n individual task orders, but may include lifecycle tasks in one or
more of the following areas:

e TASK AREA 1: Network and Telecommunication Services

e TASK AREA 3: Enterprise Service Delivery (ESD)

e TASK AREA 4: Defense Business System (DBS) Life Cycle Management: Acquisition,
Development, Sustainment, Maintenance and Technical Support
e TASK AREA 5: Lifecycle Program Support Services
