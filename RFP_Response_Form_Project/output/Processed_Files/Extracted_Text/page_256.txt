encouraged to propose Cost CLIN(s) in their proposals accordingly.

Note: If a small business submits a proposal, inclusive of Cost CLIN(s), but is determined that
their accounting system 1s not DCAA Approved, they will still be eligible for award but will not
receive credit for having Cost CLINs and Cost CLIN(s) will not be included in their IDIQ
contract if they receive an award.

The Government will not conduct a cost-realism analysis of Cost-type CLINs at the IDIQ level.
Rather, the Government will conduct cost-realism analyses at the task order level for cost-
reimbursement orders. With this in mind, the Government has approved the following Individual
