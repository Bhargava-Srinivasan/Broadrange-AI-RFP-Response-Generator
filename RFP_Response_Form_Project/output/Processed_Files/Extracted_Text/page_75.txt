Cybersecurity Assessment Program (CAP)

The objectives of this task are to improve the cybersecurity posture of all DLA activities
and to enforce compliance with OMB, DOD, DLA, and other applicable cybersecurity
policies. The Government requires certified, highly knowledgeable, and skilled personnel
with proper security clearances in performing cybersecurity assessments to meet these
objectives.

The contractor shall provide Cybersecurity Compliance Review (CCR) Support. DLA’s
Cybersecurity Compliance Reviews (CCR) consists of several types of assessments:

1. The contractor shall:

(a) Provide Cybersecurity Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) Support -
The CVA identifies, quantifies, prioritizes, and suggests the best method
for eliminating or mitigating the vulnerabilities that exist in systems and
enclaves. Moreover, it points out which systems are noncompliant with
DOD and DLA security policies.

(1) The contractor shall perform a CVA on individual segments of
DLA’s network or may be tasked to focus on a particular
compliance area across the DLA Enterprise at the direction of the
appointed government representative.

(2) In cases where STIGs, SRGs and DOD policy is absent such as
with emerging technologies, the contractor will provide review
based on vendor and current industry best practice.

(3) The contractor will document non-compliance and assist DLA
Network and System Administrators with identifying a course of
action for remediation.

(4) The contractor will develop and document repeatable processes for
performing each type of assessment to be compiled into a DLA
CVA Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The contractor will
identify lessons learned and generate after action reports as
required for the CAP.
