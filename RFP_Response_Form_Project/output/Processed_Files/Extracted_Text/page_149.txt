PAYMENTS

The following procedures will apply to the resultant task orders:

a. The contractor shall submit a monthly invoice for the 100% monthly
amount for each task order. As part of the COR’s monthly certification
process, the COR will indicate on the invoice submitted the amounts
authorized for payment for each task based on the performance measures
described in the task order. Payments may also be made on an other than
monthly basis, such as when on a milestone event or deliverable is
completed; this would be specified in the individual task orders.

b. The determination for payment will be made in accordance with the
procedures set forth below.

F.3.3.2 PERFORMANCE REVIEW AND PAYMENTS

Performance Measurement Metrics — The contractor’s performance will be
monitored by the CORs for each task order. The tasks will be rated on the
performance of the contractor on the timeliness and quality of the services
provided using the adjectival ratings for each criterion as shown below. A
“Satisfactory” rating is based on 100% compliance with required quality and
timeliness (1.e., 100% of performance and deliverables meets or exceeds task
order requirements, and there are no customer complaints or issues). For any
rating less than Satisfactory, the Contracting Officer will review the performance
documentation and make the final determination for the rating. Payment of the
full monthly price for a task order requires a Satisfactory rating for task order
performance for the applicable monthly period.

Below are the Performance Standards that will be used in evaluating performance
in determining the amount of the payment owed to the contractor.

Performance standards and ratings are designed to determine if performance
meets or does not meet a given metric and acceptable quality level. The
performance will be rated by the COR prior to payment. These findings will be
the basis for the amount paid for that period. Note: The application of these
performance ratings or failure of the Government to apply these performance
ratings does not waive any of the Government’s rights to other remedies under
this contract or otherwise available to the Government. The following overall
ratings will be used:
