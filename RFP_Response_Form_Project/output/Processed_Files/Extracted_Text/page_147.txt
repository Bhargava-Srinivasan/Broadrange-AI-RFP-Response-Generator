requirements and agency policies and procedures.

F.3.2 METHOD OF SURVEILLANCE

The Government will ensure quality assurance and timeliness of all tasks via COR
Inspections and Customer Feedback. The Government will normally inspect and
evaluate performance of each completed task or deliverable required in the task order
PWS.

F.3.2.1 INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Actual deliverable requirements will be detailed under resultant Task Order(s).

Final inspection and acceptance of all work performed, reports and other
deliverables will be performed at the place of delivery by the COR. All
deliverables will be inspected for content, completeness, accuracy, legibility and
conformance to contract requirements by the COR. At the discretion of the COR,
inspection may include validation of information or software through the use of
automated tools and/or testing of the deliverables, as specified in the task order
PWS.

If the COR finds that a draft or final deliverable contains spelling errors,
grammatical errors, improper format, or otherwise does not conform to the
requirements stated within the contract SOW and/or task order PWS, the
document may be immediately rejected without further review and returned to the
contractor for correction and re-submission. If the contractor requires additional
Government guidance to produce an acceptable draft, the contractor shall arrange
a meeting with the COR.

The basis for acceptance shall be compliance with the requirements set forth in
this SOW and/or the task order PWS, the contractor's proposal and other terms
and conditions of the contract. Deliverable items rejected shall be corrected in
accordance with the applicable clauses. Reports and document deliverables will
be accepted when all discrepancies, errors or other deficiencies identified in
writing by the COR have been corrected to the Governmentâ€™s satisfaction.

F.3.2.2 SURVEILLANCE SCHEDULE/STAFF
The specified checks and measures will be completed on daily, weekly and

monthly schedules depending on the task. Specific surveillance schedules for
tasks will be designated in task orders.
