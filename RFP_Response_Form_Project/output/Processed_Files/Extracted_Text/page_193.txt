(11) One or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust.

(b) Unless exempted, there is a 2 percent tax of the amount of a specified Federal
procurement payment on any foreign person receiving such payment. See 26 U.S.C. 5000C and
its implementing regulations at 26 CFR 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-7.

(c) Exemptions from withholding under this provision are described at 26 CFR 1.5000C-
1(d)(5) through (7). The Offeror would claim an exemption from the withholding by using the
Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Form W-14, Certificate of
Foreign Contracting Party Receiving Federal Procurement Payments, available via the internet
at www.irs.gov/w14. Any exemption claimed and self-certified on the IRS Form W-14 is subject
to audit by the IRS. Any disputes regarding the imposition and collection of the 26 U.S.C. 5000C
tax are adjudicated by the IRS as the 26 U.S.C. 5000C tax is a tax matter, not a contract issue.
The IRS Form W-14 is provided to the acquiring agency rather than to the IRS.

(d) For purposes of withholding under 26 U.S.C. 5000C, the Offeror represents that
(1) It[_ ]is |] 1s not a foreign person; and

(2) If the Offeror indicates "1s" in paragraph (d)(1) of this provision, then
the Offeror represents that—I am claiming on the IRS Form W-14 [| a full exemption, or[ _|
partial or no exemption [Offeror shall select one] from the excise tax.

(e) If the Offeror represents it is a foreign person in paragraph (d)(1) of this provision,
then—

(1) The clause at FAR 52.229-12, Tax on Certain Foreign Procurements, will be
included in any resulting contract; and

(2) The Offeror shall submit with its offer the IRS Form W-14. If the IRS Form W-14
is not submitted with the offer, exemptions will not be applied to any resulting contract and the
Government will withhold a full 2 percent of each payment.

(f) If the Offeror selects "is" in paragraph (d)(1) and "partial or no exemption" in
paragraph (d)(2) of this provision, the Offeror will be subject to withholding in accordance with
the clause at FAR 52.229-12, Tax on Certain Foreign Procurements, in any resulting contract.

(g) A taxpayer may, for a fee, seek advice from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as to
the proper tax treatment of a transaction. This is called a private letter ruling. Also, the
IRS may publish a revenue ruling, which is an official interpretation by the IRS of the Internal
Revenue Code, related statutes, tax treaties, and regulations. A revenue ruling is the conclusion
of the IRS on how the law is applied to a specific set of facts. For questions relating to the
interpretation of the IRS regulations go to https://www.irs.gov/help/tax-law-questions.
