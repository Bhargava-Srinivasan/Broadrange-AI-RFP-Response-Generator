C.4.6 TASK AREA 6 — Cybersecurity Support Services

DLA relies on information systems to carry out its mission and business functions in a
global setting. These systems are susceptible to exploitation through targeted attacks,
natural disasters, and human and system errors. Compromise of any information system
could jeopardize logistical operations and endanger other organizations and national
interests. To combat these threats, the Department of Defense utilizes cybersecurity as its
first line of defense.

Cybersecurity is the collection of tools, policies, security concepts and safeguards,
guidelines, training, and best practices, used to protect the cyber environment, and
organizational assets. These assets include connected computing devices, applications,
services, telecommunications systems, and the transmitted or stored information in the
cyber environment. Cybersecurity strives to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, or
availability of such information.
