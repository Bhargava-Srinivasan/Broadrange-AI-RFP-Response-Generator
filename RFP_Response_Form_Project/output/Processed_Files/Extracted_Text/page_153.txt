during post-award task order competition.

The acquisition will allow for individual task orders to be set-aside for small
businesses in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(1)(F). Requirements at the task
order level may be set-aside, under Group A competition, for all Small
Businesses, Woman-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned
Small Business, and HUBZone Small Business only. In addition, all task orders
appropriate for 8(a) contractors may be restricted for 8(a) competition, in
accordance with FAR 19.803(b)(4)(1), or sole sourced directly to an 8(a)

After IDIQs are awarded, three socio-economic groups will be established as
Group A (all small business and 8(a) IDIQ contract holders), Group B (all 8(a)
IDIQ contract holders), and Group C (all IDIQ contract holders). Small Business
contractors will be eligible to compete on unrestricted task orders competed in
Group C and 100% small business set-aside task orders competed in Group A.
