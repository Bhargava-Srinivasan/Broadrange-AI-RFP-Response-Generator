FIRM-FIXED PRICE LABOR RATES

a. Government Site Rates — When performing at Government sites, the contractor shall
furnish fully burdened personnel rates which do not reflect costs for government
provided resources.
The Government will provide only office space, furniture, and
office equipment and supplies, as described in Section C.8 of the Performance Work
Statement.
DLA J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0
SP4709-23-R-0001

b. Contractor Site Rates — When performing at a contractor site, the contractor shall
furnish fully burdened personnel rates, which include costs for office space and all
normal supplies and services required to support the work.
This includes, but is not
limited to, telephones, faxes, copiers, personal computers, postage (to include courier
services such as Federal Express), ordinary business software (e.g., word processing,
spreadsheets, graphics, etc.), normal copying and reproduction costs.
c. Rates offered by contractors shall reflect fully burdened hourly rates for each labor
category (LCAT).
The fully burdened labor rates shall include all direct, indirect,
general and administrative costs and profit associated with providing the required
skill.
The fully-burdened labor rates shall include all labor and labor-related costs,
such as, but not limited to, the following list of representative labor-related costs:
salaries, wages, bonuses to include stock bonuses, incentive awards, employee stock
options, stock appreciation rights, employee stock ownership plans, employee
insurance, fringe benefits, contributions to pension, other post-retirement benefits,
annuity, employee incentive compensation plans, incentive pay, shift differentials,
overtime, vacation time, sick pay, holidays, and all other allowances based upon a
comprehensive employee compensation plan.
Contractor site rates shall also include
contractor-provided facilities, furniture, equipment, supplies, tool kits, employee
training and overhead amounts required for work at contractor site rates.
This
includes, but is not limited to, telephones, facsimile machines and their
telecommunications lines, copiers, personal computers, postage (to include courier
services such as Federal Express), ordinary business software, such as word
processing, spreadsheets, graphics, normal copying and reproduction costs.
The rates that are set-forth in the IDIQ contract are ceiling rates and cannot be
exceeded on any resultant task order.
A contractor may offer multiple ceiling rates for
task orders that have a period of performance that spans across multiple IDIQ years;
however, the subsequent year’s rates shall only take effect when the task order period
of performance crosses into the next IDIQ year.
For example, if a task order’s
performance spans across the IDIQ year one and year two, each year’s ceiling rates
will apply for the relevant time periods.
The established ceiling rates shall only reflect
services performed within the Continental United States (CONUS).
All costs
excluded from the established ceiling rates associated with services performed
Outside the Continental United States (OQCONUS) shall be priced via Other Direct
Costs (ODCs).
e. Inthe event a task order requires services to be performed OCONUS and work is
required for which the contractor can be expected to incur costs specific to OCONUS
performance, such as Defense Base Act Insurance Coverage for OCONUS
contractors, relocation, overseas health care, OCONUS overhead operating costs,
work visas, vehicle lease, OCONUS cell phone card, meals and incidental expenses,
overseas housing allowance, and cost of living allowance, consideration will be given

Page 10 of 256
DLA J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0
SP4709-23-R-0001

to pricing these costs on a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP), Time and Material (T&M), or Cost
basis as ODCs.
The task order Performance Work Statement (PWS) will identify
which OCONUS costs will be required to be offered as FFP, T&M CLINs or Cost
CLIN.
After award, the Government will disclose the ceiling rates for each awardee for IDIQ
years | through 12 for both Government and Contractor Sites.
The ceiling rates of all
awardees will be disseminated to each awarded offeror at the time of award.

F.3.1 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY

Performance measures will be used to assess the contractor’s performance under each
task order awarded against the resultant IDIQs in order to determine whether the
contractor 1s performing at required levels.
Performance measures specific to the services
required under each task order will be defined under the individual task orders.
The Government will make objective and subjective assessments of the contractor’s
performance to determine whether contract performance is acceptable.
The contractor is
expected to perform all functions 1n a professional manner and prepare accurate and
timely documentation.
Progress will normally be tracked based on the milestone event
when the contractor receives a specific tasking.
Performance may vary with the

Page 146 of 256
DLA J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0
SP4709-23-R-0001

complexity of the acquisition and/or technical document.
It is expected that the
documentation and procedures will comply with all major regulatory and process
requirements and agency policies and procedures.
F.3.2 METHOD OF SURVEILLANCE

The Government will ensure quality assurance and timeliness of all tasks via COR
Inspections and Customer Feedback.
The Government will normally inspect and
evaluate performance of each completed task or deliverable required in the task order
PWS.
F.3.2.1 INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Actual deliverable requirements will be detailed under resultant Task Order(s).
Final inspection and acceptance of all work performed, reports and other
deliverables will be performed at the place of delivery by the COR.
All
deliverables will be inspected for content, completeness, accuracy, legibility and
conformance to contract requirements by the COR.
At the discretion of the COR,
inspection may include validation of information or software through the use of
automated tools and/or testing of the deliverables, as specified in the task order
PWS.
If the COR finds that a draft or final deliverable contains spelling errors,
grammatical errors, improper format, or otherwise does not conform to the
requirements stated within the contract SOW and/or task order PWS, the
document may be immediately rejected without further review and returned to the
contractor for correction and re-submission.
If the contractor requires additional
Government guidance to produce an acceptable draft, the contractor shall arrange
a meeting with the COR.
The basis for acceptance shall be compliance with the requirements set forth in
this SOW and/or the task order PWS, the contractor's proposal and other terms
and conditions of the contract.
Deliverable items rejected shall be corrected in
accordance with the applicable clauses.
Reports and document deliverables will
be accepted when all discrepancies, errors or other deficiencies identified in
writing by the COR have been corrected to the Government’s satisfaction.
F.3.2.2 SURVEILLANCE SCHEDULE/STAFF
The specified checks and measures will be completed on daily, weekly and

monthly schedules depending on the task.
Specific surveillance schedules for
tasks will be designated in task orders.
DLA J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0
SP4709-23-R-0001
The surveillance staff has two components:

a. Contracting Officer/Task Order Contracting Officer:

The primary function of the Contracting Officer, with regard to the
surveillance activity, is to authorize changes to the SOW or a task order
PWS.
The Contracting Officer is responsible for ensuring the completion
of all work in accordance with the SOW and task order PWS.
The
Contracting Officer will rely on the COR to provide information and
recommendations.
b. COR/Task Order COR:

The COR’s responsibility is to monitor and inspect, report, and make
recommendations to the Contracting Officer regarding the quality of
contractor work performed, or not performed.
When necessary, the COR
will solicit feedback from the customer regarding the quality of the work
performed.
F.3.3 GENERAL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

General quality measures, as set forth below, will be applied to each work product
received from the contractor under any resultant task order.
These performance
measurements are defined as:

Quality

e Accuracy — Work products shall be accurate in presentation, technical content,
and adherence to accepted elements of style.
e Clarity — Work products shall be clear and concise.
Any/all diagrams shall be easy
to understand and be relevant to the supporting narrative.
e Consistency to Requirements — All work products must satisfy the requirements
of the Performance Work Statement.

DLA J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0
SP4709-23-R-0001

F.3.3.1 FIXED PRICE PERFORMANCE BASED SERVICE CONTRACT
PAYMENTS

The following procedures will apply to the resultant task orders:

a.
The contractor shall submit a monthly invoice for the 100% monthly
amount for each task order.
As part of the COR’s monthly certification
process, the COR will indicate on the invoice submitted the amounts
authorized for payment for each task based on the performance measures
described in the task order.
Payments may also be made on an other than
monthly basis, such as when on a milestone event or deliverable is
completed; this would be specified in the individual task orders.
The determination for payment will be made in accordance with the
procedures set forth below.
F.3.3.2 PERFORMANCE REVIEW AND PAYMENTS

Performance Measurement Metrics — The contractor’s performance will be
monitored by the CORs for each task order.
The tasks will be rated on the
performance of the contractor on the timeliness and quality of the services
provided using the adjectival ratings for each criterion as shown below.
A
“Satisfactory” rating is based on 100% compliance with required quality and
timeliness (1.e., 100% of performance and deliverables meets or exceeds task
order requirements, and there are no customer complaints or issues).
For any
rating less than Satisfactory, the Contracting Officer will review the performance
documentation and make the final determination for the rating.
Payment of the
full monthly price for a task order requires a Satisfactory rating for task order
performance for the applicable monthly period.
Below are the Performance Standards that will be used in evaluating performance
in determining the amount of the payment owed to the contractor.
Performance standards and ratings are designed to determine if performance
meets or does not meet a given metric and acceptable quality level.
The
performance will be rated by the COR prior to payment.
These findings will be
the basis for the amount paid for that period.
Note: The application of these
performance ratings or failure of the Government to apply these performance
ratings does not waive any of the Government’s rights to other remedies under
this contract or otherwise available to the Government.
The following overall
ratings will be used:

Overall Performance Ratings

Satisfactory — Performance meets or exceeds contractual requirements.
The

contractual performance reflects some minor problem(s) for which corrective

SECTION H: SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

H.1 PROPOSAL EVALUATION / IDIQ AWARD DETERMINATION

a.

The Contractor’s Labor Rate Table Pricing will be used 1n negotiating task order
pricing.
The labor categories and rates will be included in the IDIQ contracts and
will serve as a ceiling, representing the highest hourly rate an awardee can offer
during post-award task order competition.
The acquisition will allow for individual task orders to be set-aside for small
businesses in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(1)(F).
Requirements at the task
order level may be set-aside, under Group A competition, for all Small
Businesses, Woman-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned
Small Business, and HUBZone Small Business only.
In addition, all task orders
appropriate for 8(a) contractors may be restricted for 8(a) competition, in
accordance with FAR 19.803(b)(4)(1), or sole sourced directly to an 8(a)
contractor in accordance with FAR 19.803(b)(4)(1).
After IDIQs are awarded, three socio-economic groups will be established as
Group A (all small business and 8(a) IDIQ contract holders), Group B (all 8(a)
IDIQ contract holders), and Group C (all IDIQ contract holders).
Small Business
contractors will be eligible to compete on unrestricted task orders competed in
Group C and 100% small business set-aside task orders competed in Group A.
8(a) contractors will be eligible to compete on all unrestricted task orders and task
orders set-aside 100% for small businesses.
All task orders appropriate for 8(a)
contractors may be restricted for Group B competition, in accordance with FAR
19.803(b)(4)(11), or sole sourced directly to a Group B (8(a) business) contractor
in accordance with FAR 19.803(b)(4)().
All other-than-small business contractors
will only be eligible to compete on unrestricted task orders competed in Group C.
All other task orders will be competed amongst the IDIQ holders unless an
exception, outlined in FAR 16.505(b)(2), applies.
Resulting task orders are
intended to satisfy the full range of IT related requirements within the area of
scope outlined in the SOW.
Separate groups for socio-economic categories under
Group A, such as Woman-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-
Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business and HUBZone Small
Business, will not have separate pools established at the IDIQ level.
Requirements
at the task order level may be set-aside, under Group A competition, for all Small
Businesses, Woman-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned
Small Business, and HUBZone Small Business only.
These set-asides may apply
when there are 2 or more small businesses under these socio-economic categories
are able and available to submit proposals to specific requirements.
All Small business contractors that receive IDIQ awards will be authorized to
receive small business set-aside task orders for the first five years (base period) of

Page 153 of 256
DLA J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0
SP4709-23-R-0001

the IDIQ performance period.
In accordance with 13 CFR 121.404(g) (3), 120
days prior to the end of the base period, all small business IDIQ holders will be
requested to re-certify to maintain their small business status for the last five years
(option period) of the IDIQ.
If it is discovered that a small business contractor has
lost its small business status after the re-certification process, 1t may continue to
hold its IDIQ contract, but will be excluded from competing on task orders
directed to Group A.
In order to maintain adequate competition in Group A, the
Government may solicit additional small business contractors, if there is a need to
replace contractors that no longer maintain small business status after re-
certification.
If the Government determines that additional small business
contractors are required, the Government will issue an RFP requesting offers from
small business contractors and will award the necessary amount of IDIQs to
ensure adequate competition in Group A. Selection of those contractors will
follow source selection procedures and criteria used to award the initial IDIQ
contracts.
The maximum potential contract-ordering period for large and small
businesses will be ten years (five (5) year base period and a five (5) year option
period).
e. All 8(a) contractors that receive IDIQ awards will be eligible to receive 8(a) task
orders for the first five years (base period) of the IDIQ performance period.
Per
13 CFR 121.404(g) (3), 120 days prior to the end of the base period, all 8(a) IDIQ
holders will be requested to re-certify to maintain their 8(a) status for the last five
years (option period) of the IDIQ.
If it is discovered that an 8(a) contractor has
lost its 8(a) status after the re-certification process, it may continue to hold its
IDIQ contract, but will be excluded from competing on task orders directed to
Group B.
In order to maintain adequate competition in Group B, the Government
may solicit additional 8(a) contractors, 1f there 1s a need to replace contractors that
graduate from the 8(a) program after re-certification.
If the Government
determines that additional 8(a) contractors are required, the Government will
issue an RFP requesting offers from 8(a) contractors and will award the necessary
number of IDIQs to ensure adequate competition in Group B. Selection of those
contractors will follow source selection procedures and criteria used to award the
initial IDIQ contracts.
The maximum potential contract-ordering period for large
and small businesses will be ten years (five (5) year base period and a five (5)
year option period).
H.2 OFF-RAMP/ON-RAMP
H.2.1 OFF-RAMP
To ensure the success of JETS, each JETS IDIQ Holder 1s required to participate in the
JETS Ordering process by submitting proposals in response to task order Request for

Quotations (RFQs) for which the JETS IDIQ Holder has a reasonable chance for award,
to successfully perform the terms of its Orders, and to promptly improve performance

Page 154 of 256
DLA J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0
SP4709-23-R-0001

when it does not meet the terms of the Orders.
If a JETS IDIQ Holder does not meet
these requirements, it is the Government’s intent to “off-ramp” the IDIQ Holder by:

(a) Permitting such Contractor’s JETS IDIQ Contract to expire instead of exercising
the Option; or

(b) Implementing a termination for convenience (if applicable and only if such action
is in the Government’s best interest); or

(c) Implementing a termination for default, 1f applicable; or

(d) Taking any other action which may be permitted under the JETS IDIQ Contract’s
terms and conditions.
H.2.2 ON-RAMP

Consistent with FAR 16.504(c)(1)(11)(A), the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) has
determined that it is in the Government’s best interest that at all times during the term of
the Basic Contract, there remain an adequate number of JETS IDIQ Holders eligible to
compete for task orders.
Over time, the total number of JETS IDIQ Holders may fluctuate
due to various reasons including industry consolidation, significant changes in the
marketplace or advances in technology, general economic conditions, the Government's
exercise of the off-ramp process, or other reasons.
Recognizing this, DLA intends to
periodically review the total number of JETS IDIQ Holders participating in the JETS
Ordering Process and determine whether it would be in the Government’s best interest to
initiate an open season to add new contractors to the JETS Basic Contract.
Open Season Procedures

If DLA determines that it would be in the Government’s best interest to open a new
solicitation to add new IDIQ Holders to JETS, the JETS PCO may do so at any time
provided that:

(a)
The solicitation is issued under then-applicable federal procurement law;

(b) The solicitation identifies the total approximate number of new awards that the
JETS PCO intends to make.
The JETS PCO may decide to award more or fewer
JETS IDIQ Contracts than the number anticipated in the solicitation depending
upon the overall quality of the offers received;

(c) Any Contractor that meets the eligibility requirements set forth in the new
solicitation may submit a proposal 1n response to the solicitation; however,
existing JETS IDIQ Holders may not hold more than one JETS Basic Contract at
any time;

(d)
The award decision under any solicitation is based upon substantially the same
evaluation factors/sub-factors as the original solicitation;

(e) The terms and conditions of any resulting awards from a new solicitation are
materially identical to the existing version of the Basic Contract;

Page 155 of 256
DLA J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0
SP4709-23-R-0001

(f)
The term for any such new awards from a solicitation is co-terminus with the
existing term for all other JETS IDIQ Holders, including the option period (if
applicable);

(g) If awarded a JETS IDIQ Contract, any new JETS IDIQ Holder 1s eligible to
submit a proposal in response to any task order RFQ and receive Task Order
awards with the same rights and obligations as any other JETS IDIQ Holder; and

(h) The award of any new JETS Contract(s) does not increase the overall ceiling of
the Basic Contract.
H.3 FAIR OPPORTUNITY - ORDERING/TASK ORDER REQUEST PROCESS:

a. Fair Opportunity: Award of each task order will be made to the offeror whose
quote represents the best value in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated in
the request for quotes for the task order.
b. Non-DLA Agency Ordering Requirements and Fee for Service

When a DoD requesting agency, other than DLA, requests an order against the
resultant IDIQ, that agency shall furnish the following information at the time of
order:

1) Either a Determination and Findings (D&F) in accordance with FAR
17.502-2(c) or DD Form 1144 and;
2) A Military Interdepartmental Purchase Order Request (MIPR)

The D&F, per the requirements of FAR 17.502-2(c), shall—

(1) State that use of an interagency acquisition 1s in the best interest of the
Government;

(11) State that the supplies or services cannot be obtained as conveniently
or economically by contracting directly with a private source; and

(111) Include a statement that at least one of the following circumstances
applies:

(A)
The acquisition will appropriately be made under an existing
contract of the servicing agency, entered into before placement of the
order, to meet the requirement of the servicing agency for the same or
similar supplies or services.
The servicing agency has the capability or expertise to enter into a
contract for such supplies or services that is not available within the
requesting agency.
The servicing agency 1s specifically authorized by law or

regulation to purchase such supplies or services on behalf of other
agencies.
DLA J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0

SP4709-23-R-0001

The D&F shall be approved by a contracting officer of the requesting agency
with authority to contract for the supplies or services to be ordered, or by
another official designated by the agency head, except that, if the servicing
agency 1s not covered by the FAR, approval of the D&F may not be
delegated below the senior procurement executive of the requesting agency.
In transactions between DoD activities, if the transaction 1s
documented on a DD Form 1144 support agreement signed by the head of
the requiring and supplying agency, then no further written determinations
are required.
If no support agreement exists, then the D&F is required.
A Fee for Service of 2.25% (subject to change) for centralized ordering and
1% (subject to change) for de-centralized ordering, or a minimum of
$5,000.00, whichever is higher, will be required by the servicing agency
(DLA) from the requesting agency on all direct acquisitions and will be
submitted via a direct fund cite MIPR.
MIPRs from the requesting agency
will be coordinated with the appropriate financial office.
The application of
the Fee for Service is at the sole discretion of the servicing agency.
c. Competition process for all task orders following the award of multiple IDIQs:

a.

Group A will consist of all Small Business IDIQ holders, which includes
8(a) contractors.
All Group A contractors will be eligible to compete on all
unrestricted task orders and task orders set-aside 100% for small

19.803(b)(4)(11), or sole sourced directly to a Group B contractor in
accordance with FAR 19.803(b)(4)q).
All Group C contractors will be
eligible to compete on all unrestricted task orders.
The Government reserves the right to direct orders to a particular source
under urgent circumstances, to meet contractual minimums, or to provide
economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to an order already issued
in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2).
In accordance with FAR 16.505
(b)(1)(G), the government reserves the right to direct orders under $3,000

Acceptable (LPTA) basis or by utilizing a trade-off process as indicated in
the RFQ.
The Contracting Officer will review the returned quotes and
select the awardee based upon a source selection determination as
specified in the RFQ.
Evaluation factors may include price, technical
expertise and past performance; however, other factors may be included as
well.
If past performance is included as an evaluation factor, the
Government may consider past performance on previous JETS task orders,
among other past performance history.

offered in response to an RFQ do not exceed the established Hourly Labor
Rate Table ceiling rates.
H.4 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST:
The provisions of FAR Subpart 9.5, Organization and Consultant Conflicts of Interest,
concerning organizational conflicts of interest govern task orders issued under this
contract.
Potential conflicts may exist in accordance with FAR 9.505-1, Providing
Systems Development and Engineering and Technical Direction, through 9.505-4,
Obtaining Access to Proprietary Information.
The contractor is responsible for
identifying any actual or potential organizational conflict of interest to the Contracting
Officer that would arise as the result of the issuance of a task order under this contract.
The Contracting Officer will determine on a case-by-case, task order by task order, basis
whether a conflict of interest 1s likely to arise.
To avoid or mitigate a potential conflict,
the task order Contracting Officer will impose appropriate constraints, such as the
following:
The contractor agrees that if it provides, under a contract or task order, systems
engineering and technical guidance for systems and programs, but does not have
overall contractual responsibility, it will not be allowed to be awarded a contract
or task order to supply the system or any of its major components or be a
subcontractor or consultant to a supplier of the system or any of its major
components (FAR 9.505-1).
The contractor agrees that if 1t prepares specifications for non-developmental
items or assists in the preparation of work statements for a system or services
under a contract or task order, it will not be allowed to furnish these items, either
as a prime contractor, a subcontractor or as a consultant (FAR 9.505-2).
The contractor agrees that if it gains access to proprietary data of other
companies, it will protect such data and it will not use such proprietary data in
supplying systems or components in future competitive procurements (FAR
9.505-4).
In addition, the contractor agrees to protect the proprietary data and
rights of other organizations disclosed to the contractor during performance of
any task order with the same caution that a reasonably prudent contractor would
use to safeguard highly valuable property.
The contractor also agrees that if it
gains access to the proprietary information of other companies, it will enter into
an agreement with the other companies to protect their information from
unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and refrain
from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was
furnished.
DLA J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0
SP4709-23-R-0001

d.
The contractor agrees that it will not distribute reports, data or information of any
nature arising from its performance under this contract, except as provided by the
task order or as may be directed by the task order contracting officer.
The contractor agrees that it will neither evaluate nor advise the Government with
regard to its own products or activities.
The contractor will objectively evaluate or
advise the Government concerning products or activities of any prospective
competitors.
The contractor agrees that it will include the above provisions, including this
paragraph, in agreements with teaming partners, consultants or subcontractors at
any tier which involve access to information covered above.
The use of this clause
in such agreements shall be read by substituting the word "consultant" or
"subcontractor" for the word "contractor" whenever the latter appears.
The contractor shall effectively educate its employees, through formal training, company
policy, information directives and procedures, in an awareness of the legal provisions of
FAR Subpart 9.5 and its underlying policy and principles so that each employee will
know and understand the provisions of that Subpart and the absolute necessity of
safeguarding information under a task order from anyone other than the contractor's
employees who have a need to know, and the U.S. Government.
The term contractor herein used means: (1) the organization (hereinafter referred to as
"it" or "1ts") entering into this agreement with the Government; (2) all business
organizations with which it may merge, join or affiliate now or in the future and in any
manner whatsoever, or which hold or may obtain, by purchase or otherwise, direct or
indirect control of it; (3) its parent organization if any and any of its present or future
subsidiaries, associates, affiliates, or holding companies, and; (4) any organization or
enterprise over which it has direct or indirect control now or in the future.
In connection with a particular constraint, the contractor may submit a response to the
task order contracting officer for the purpose of indicating potential measures to avoid or
mitigate a conflict.
In the event the task order contracting officer determines that a
conflict exists which cannot be effectively mitigated the provision in FAR 9.5 must be
followed.
H.4.1 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST MITIGATION PLAN
The Government requires that a contractor-provided Organizational Conflict of Interest
(OCI) mitigation plan be submitted if a perceived or actual OCI exists.
Further, all

personnel must receive company sponsored OCI training within 30 days of performing
this contract.
DLA J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0
SP4709-23-R-0001

H.4.2 NOTICE OF POTENTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF
INTEREST

a. Notice.
The Contracting Officer has determined that this acquisition may
give rise to an organizational conflict of interest (OCI).
Accordingly, the
attention of prospective Offerors is invited to FAR Subpart 9.5 --
Organizational Conflicts of Interest.
The Contracting Officer shall not
award a contract until the Government determines any conflict of interest
is reasonably resolved.
The Contracting Officer has the sole authority to
determine whether an organizational conflict of interest exists and to
determine whether the organizational conflict of interest has been
reasonably resolved.
The OCI plan will not be evaluated as part of mission
suitability.
However, before being eligible to receive an award, the Offeror
shall submit an acceptable OCI plan (including mitigation plans for any
identified OCIs).
As such, the Government may communicate with any
Offeror at any time during the evaluation process concerning its OCI plan.
b. Description of Potential Conflict.
The nature of this potential
organizational conflict of interest is the existence of conflicting roles that
might bias a contractor’s judgment or the existence of an unfair
competitive advantage.
At this time, no organizational conflict of interest
is identified.
c. Responsibility of Offeror:

1) Applying the principles of FAR Subpart 9.5, each Offeror
shall assess whether there is an organizational conflict of
interest associated with the proposal it submits.
The Offeror
must explain the actions it intends to use to resolve any
organizational conflicts of interest it finds in the
Government’s assessment and its own assessment.
If its
proposed resolution involves a proposed limitation on
future contracting, the Offeror shall include the limitation
in its proposal.
If the proposed resolution involves use of
mitigation techniques, the Offeror shall include the
mitigation techniques in its proposal.
Offerors may include
the limitation of future contracting as well as a mitigation
plan when their proposed resolution involves both
techniques to address conflicts.
2) Offerors are encouraged to inform the Contracting Officer

of any potential conflicts of interest, including those
involving contracts with other Government organizations,

Page 161 of 256
DLA J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0
SP4709-23-R-0001

in their proposal.
The contracting officer will use this
information to determine whether resolution of those
conflicts will be required.
3) Ifthe Offeror’s proposed action to resolve an
organizational conflict of interest is not acceptable, the

All other small business
participation efforts included in the contractor’s proposal will be monitored
during contract performance.
All IDIQ contract holders will be required to submit a “Small Business
Subcontractor Report’, which demonstrates how the contractor is achieving their
small business participation targets.
The report shall be submitted no later than 30
days prior to the end of an IDIQ contract year.
*Small business Offerors may meet the requirement using work performed
themselves.
For other-than-small businesses:

of FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, contractors must
submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9,
as supplemented by DFARS 252.219-7003, that will be incorporated into the

Any disputes regarding the imposition and collection of the 26 U.S.C. 5000C
tax are adjudicated by the IRS as the 26 U.S.C. 5000C tax is a tax matter, not a contract issue.
The IRS Form W-14 is provided to the acquiring agency rather than to the IRS.

(1) It
[_ ]is |] 1s not a foreign person; and

(2) If the Offeror indicates "1s" in paragraph (d)(1) of this provision, then

(1) The clause at FAR 52.229-12, Tax on Certain Foreign Procurements, will be
included in any resulting contract; and

(2) The Offeror shall submit with its offer the IRS Form W-14.
If the IRS Form W-14
is not submitted with the offer, exemptions will not be applied to any resulting contract and the
Government will withhold a full 2 percent of each payment.
(f) If the Offeror selects "is" in paragraph (d)(1) and "partial or no exemption" in
paragraph (d)(2) of this provision, the Offeror will be subject to withholding in accordance with
the clause at FAR 52.229-12, Tax on Certain Foreign Procurements, in any resulting contract.
(g) A taxpayer may, for a fee, seek advice from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as to
the proper tax treatment of a transaction.
This is called a private letter ruling.
Also, the
IRS may publish a revenue ruling, which is an official interpretation by the IRS of the Internal
Revenue Code, related statutes, tax treaties, and regulations.
A revenue ruling is the conclusion
of the IRS on how the law is applied to a specific set of facts.

controlled information systems shall observe all local automated information system (AIS)
security policies and procedures.
Violations of local AIS security policy, such as password
sharing, performing personal work, file access violations, or browsing files outside the scope of
the contract, will result in removal of the contractor employee from Government property and
referral to the contractor for appropriate disciplinary action.
Actions taken by the contractor in
response to a violation will be evaluated and will be reflected in the contractor’s performance
assessment for use in making future source selection decisions.
In addition, based on the nature
and extent of any violations of AIS security policy, the Government will consider whether it
needs to pursue any other actions under the contract such as a possible termination.
(1) The contractor may also be required to obtain a Common Access Card (CAC) or
Installation Access Badge for each contractor employee in accordance with procedures

SECTION M: EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
M.1 BASIS FOR AWARD

Awards shall be made to responsible offerors whose proposals are determined to be the most
advantageous to the Government, non-price factors and cost/price considered.
The Government’s
objective is to obtain the highest quality services considered necessary to achieve program
objectives, with reasonable prices.
Award of this contract will be made on a competitive best
value basis, using “tradeoff” procedures between Non-Price and Cost/Price.
In evaluating
proposals, non-price factors, when combined, will be considered significantly more important
than price.
As proposals become more equal in merit of non-price factors, price/cost becomes
more important.
The Government may consider award to other than the lowest priced offerors or
other than the highest technically rated offerors.
Prospective offerors are advised that a proposal meeting the objectives and requirements with the
lowest price may not necessarily be selected if award to a higher priced offer 1s determined to be
most advantageous to the Government:

e
All Non-Price factors (Technical Merit, Partnering and Strategic Alliance,
Key Personnel, and Small Business Participation), when combined, will be
considered significantly more important than Cost/Price.
e Factor 1, Technical Merit, is more important than Factor 2, Partnering and
Strategic Alliance.
Within Factor 1, Technical Merit, the 2 sub-factors are of equal importance.
e Factors 1, 2,3, and 4 will be rated against set standards.
If any portion of the
information required in a factor or subfactor 1s not provided, the offeror’s
rating for such factor/subfactor may be adversely affected.
e Factor 1, Technical Merit, will be assigned a rating by rolling up the ratings
assigned to its equally-weighted subfactors, Subfactor A—Technical
Approach, and Subfactor B—Management Approach.
e Factor 3, Key Personnel, will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable
basis.
Therefore:

e Failure of an offeror to address the minimum requirements of the Key
Personnel Factor will result in an unacceptable proposal rating, and will
exclude the offeror from receiving an IDIQ award, if not addressed during
negotiations (if any are held).
DLA J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0
SP4709-23-R-0001

e Factor 4, Small Business Participation, will be evaluated on an
acceptable/unacceptable basis.
Therefore:

e Failure of an offeror to address the minimum requirements of the Small
Business Participation Factor will result in an unacceptable proposal rating
and will exclude the offeror from receiving an IDIQ award, if not
addressed during negotiations (if any are held).
The Government anticipates multiple contract awards resulting from this solicitation.
This
solicitation is being issued as an unrestricted acquisition; however, a portion of contract awards
will be reserved for small business and 8(a) offerors.
These socioeconomic reserve awards will
be made to the best value offeror(s) within each reserve category, 1n accordance with the
evaluation criteria stated in the solicitation.
IDIQ proposals will be separated into three socio-economic groups prior to evaluation of offers.
The three socio-economic groups will be other-than-small businesses, small businesses, and 8(a)
businesses.
The Government will reserve IDIQ awards for each socio-economic group, in order
to ensure adequate competition on all task orders.
These socioeconomic reserve awards will be
made to the best value offeror(s) within each reserve category, in accordance with the evaluation
criteria stated in the solicitation.
The Government intends to award multiple contracts to small
business offerors, and multiple contracts to 8(a) business offerors.
Awards will be made in Group A to the small business offerors, including 8(a) offerors, whose
proposals represent the best value in accordance with the evaluation criteria.
Awards will be
made in Group B to the 8(a) offerors whose proposals represent the best value in accordance
with the evaluation criteria.
Awards will be made 1n Group C to all offerors whose proposals
represent the best value in accordance with the evaluation criteria (including other-than-small
business offerors who proposals represent the best value, and Group A and Group B awardees).
The Technical Evaluations for proposals in receipt of this solicitation (SP4709-23-R-0001) will
be conducted 1n a two-phased approach; however, an offeror must provide all parts of its
proposal (both Phase | and Phase 2 portions) before the RFP closing date.
Offerors will NOT be
given the opportunity to submit further portions of their proposal following Phase | evaluation.
Initial proposals that fail to respond to all Phase 2 factors and subfactors will be rejected as
unacceptable without further consideration.
Proposals will be evaluated in the following two phases:
PHASE 1

1.
An offeror’s proposal for Factor 1 (Technical Merit), Subfactor A (Technical Approach) will
be evaluated during Phase 1.
Subfactor A (Technical Approach) will receive an Adjectival
rating, as described in Section M.3 below.
If an offeror’s Technical Approach proposal fails to
receive an Acceptable or higher rating, the offeror will not advance to Phase 2 of the evaluation
process, and the rest of the offeror’s proposal will not be further evaluated for any of the
remaining Non-Price or Cost/Price factors.
As a result, if an offeror does not advance to Phase 2,
they will not be considered eligible for award.
DLA J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0
SP4709-23-R-0001

Note: Those offerors which do not receive an Acceptable or higher rating for Phase 1 will
receive an Unsuccessful Offeror Letter after all proposals are reviewed under Phase 1.
Offerors
are advised to submit your firm’s best and most complete Technical Approach proposal as part
of its initial submission.
Only those offerors which receive an Acceptable or higher rating for Factor 1, Subfactor A
(Technical Approach) will advance to Phase 2 evaluations.
Phase 2 evaluations will consist of
Factor 1 (Technical Merit), Subfactor B (Management Approach);
Factor 2 (Partnering and
Strategic Alliance; Factor 3 (Key Personnel); Factor 4 (Small Business Participation); and,
Cost/Price, Factors 1 through 3.
Phase 2 factors and subfactors will be evaluated as described in
Section M.3 below, including the roll-up rating for Factor 1 (Technical Merit), which will be a
combination of the Phase | rating for Subfactor A (Technical Approach) and the Phase 2 rating
for Subfactor B (Management Approach).
The Government WILL NOT enter into discussions with any offeror whose proposal did not
receive an Acceptable or higher rating for Factor 1, Subfactor A (Technical Approach) during
Phase One.
Discussions may only be held after Phase Two evaluations, with all Offerors
determined to be in the competitive range.

The Technical Merit Subfactors are Technical
Approach and Management Approach.
Within Technical Merit, the subfactors Technical
Approach and Management Approach are of equal importance.
Technical Merit is more
important than Partnering and Strategic Alliance.
The non-Price factors, when combined, are
significantly more important than cost/price.
Key Personnel and Small Business Participation
will be rated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis.
In order to be eligible for award, offerors
must be rated Acceptable for both the Key Personnel and the Small Business Participation
factors.
Within the Price factors, Factor 1: Hourly Ceiling Rates will be evaluated for fairness and
reasonableness.
All rates must be determined fair and reasonable for a proposal to be determined
Acceptable and for the proposal to be eligible for award.
These ceiling rates will be incorporated
into the IDIQ awards.
Non-Price factors are:

bx] Significantly more important than cost or price
|_| Essentially equal to cost or price
|_| Significantly less important than cost or price
NOTE: Non-Price Evaluation Factors are significantly more important than price;
however, as proposals become more equal in their technical ratings, the evaluated price
becomes more important.

provide a price for ALL Labor Categories in Attachments 1 & 2.
If Labor Prices are missing, an
offeror may not be considered for award.
Also, please ensure pricing is no more than two (2)
decimal places are present.
No rounding of decimal places can be inserted in Attachments | & 2.
All of an offeror’s proposed rates must be determined fair and reasonable for an offeror to
receive a contract award.
The price proposal evaluations will include review of the proposed
hourly rates for each labor category for all years 1-12 in Attachments | & 2.

requirements of the RFP and will be evaluated for completeness, fairness and reasonableness.
M.4.2 Total Evaluated Price

provided in the Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM).
The total evaluated price will be the total
price added together for all Years 1-12 in both Attachments 1 & 2.
Note: Both Attachment(s) 1 & 2 will be used for Hourly Ceiling Rates & to establish a Total
Evaluated Price to be submitted by offerors at time of proposal submission.

encouraged to propose Cost CLIN(s) in their proposals accordingly.

their accounting system 1s not DCAA Approved, they will still be eligible for award but will not
receive credit for having Cost CLINs and Cost CLIN(s) will not be included in their IDIQ
contract if they receive an award.
