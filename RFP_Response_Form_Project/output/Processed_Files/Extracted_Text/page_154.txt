the IDIQ performance period. In accordance with 13 CFR 121.404(g) (3), 120
days prior to the end of the base period, all small business IDIQ holders will be
requested to re-certify to maintain their small business status for the last five years
(option period) of the IDIQ. If it is discovered that a small business contractor has
lost its small business status after the re-certification process, 1t may continue to
hold its IDIQ contract, but will be excluded from competing on task orders
directed to Group A. In order to maintain adequate competition in Group A, the
Government may solicit additional small business contractors, if there is a need to
replace contractors that no longer maintain small business status after re-
certification. If the Government determines that additional small business
contractors are required, the Government will issue an RFP requesting offers from
small business contractors and will award the necessary amount of IDIQs to
ensure adequate competition in Group A. Selection of those contractors will
follow source selection procedures and criteria used to award the initial IDIQ
contracts. The maximum potential contract-ordering period for large and small
businesses will be ten years (five (5) year base period and a five (5) year option
period).

e. All 8(a) contractors that receive IDIQ awards will be eligible to receive 8(a) task
orders for the first five years (base period) of the IDIQ performance period. Per
13 CFR 121.404(g) (3), 120 days prior to the end of the base period, all 8(a) IDIQ
holders will be requested to re-certify to maintain their 8(a) status for the last five
years (option period) of the IDIQ. If it is discovered that an 8(a) contractor has
lost its 8(a) status after the re-certification process, it may continue to hold its
IDIQ contract, but will be excluded from competing on task orders directed to
Group B. In order to maintain adequate competition in Group B, the Government
may solicit additional 8(a) contractors, 1f there 1s a need to replace contractors that
graduate from the 8(a) program after re-certification. If the Government
determines that additional 8(a) contractors are required, the Government will
issue an RFP requesting offers from 8(a) contractors and will award the necessary
number of IDIQs to ensure adequate competition in Group B. Selection of those
contractors will follow source selection procedures and criteria used to award the
initial IDIQ contracts. The maximum potential contract-ordering period for large
and small businesses will be ten years (five (5) year base period and a five (5)
year option period).
