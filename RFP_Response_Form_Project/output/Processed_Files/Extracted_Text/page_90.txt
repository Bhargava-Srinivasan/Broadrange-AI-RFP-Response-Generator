(a) Provide a transition plan to include risks and costs associated with

transition plan shall address impacts to operations due to relocation,
deployment, and breakdown.

b. Research and Development Program Management Support

This Task supports sound program management through Standard and Repeatable
Process (SRP), which 1s a set of procedures and processes, including external process
requirements in areas such as information technology, contracting, and budgets, that are
required to effectively manage a DoD R&D program. In general, the SRP follows the
guidelines established by the Defense Acquisition University (DAU) guidance for R&D
program management, and the Project Management Institute’s “Project Management
Body of Knowledge.” The support will build on previously developed, implemented, and
maintained R&D SRP procedures and processes. Changes, if any, will be managed
through a change control process that maintains traceability from the established baseline
to the revised procedure or process. The contractor will support R&D portfolio
participation in the DoD-wide ManTech Program led by the Joint Directors of
Manufacturing Technology Programs (JDMTP), of which the DLA R&D Chief is a
principal member, and DLA’s participation in the Government-wide Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs.

This support will include:
