Cybersecurity Support Services** 1. Recommended discount rate for calculating present-value cost and benefits response: Based on industry standards and best practices, Broadrange AI recommends a discount rate of 7.5% for calculating present value (PV) costs and benefits. This rate is conservative and takes into account the risk-free rate, long-term market returns, and the time-value-of-money principle.

 Sources:

* Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines for calculating PV for federal tax purposes
* The Standard & Poor's (S&P) 10-year treasury bond yield as a proxy for the risk-free rate
* Historical market returns from institutional investors and economists

PV formula:

PV = Σ (CFt / (1 + r)^t)

Where:
CFt = cash flow at time t
r = discount rate (7.5% in this case)
t = time period (in years)

By using a discount rate of 7.5%, we ensure that the PV calculations are conservative and accurately reflect the time-value-of-money principle. This rate allows for a reasonable balance between the costs and benefits of our Cybersecurity Support Services, while also providing a realistic assessment of the project's potential ROI.
