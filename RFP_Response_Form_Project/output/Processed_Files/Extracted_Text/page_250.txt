Personnel, and (4) Small Business Participation. The Technical Merit Subfactors are Technical
Approach and Management Approach. Within Technical Merit, the subfactors Technical
Approach and Management Approach are of equal importance. Technical Merit is more
important than Partnering and Strategic Alliance. The non-Price factors, when combined, are
significantly more important than cost/price. Key Personnel and Small Business Participation
will be rated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. In order to be eligible for award, offerors
must be rated Acceptable for both the Key Personnel and the Small Business Participation
factors.

Within the Price factors, Factor 1: Hourly Ceiling Rates will be evaluated for fairness and
reasonableness. All rates must be determined fair and reasonable for a proposal to be determined
Acceptable and for the proposal to be eligible for award. These ceiling rates will be incorporated
into the IDIQ awards.

Non-Price factors are:

bx] Significantly more important than cost or price
|_| Essentially equal to cost or price
|_| Significantly less important than cost or price
NOTE: Non-Price Evaluation Factors are significantly more important than price;
however, as proposals become more equal in their technical ratings, the evaluated price
becomes more important.
