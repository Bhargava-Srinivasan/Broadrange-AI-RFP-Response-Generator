H.4 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST:

The provisions of FAR Subpart 9.5, Organization and Consultant Conflicts of Interest,
concerning organizational conflicts of interest govern task orders issued under this
contract. Potential conflicts may exist in accordance with FAR 9.505-1, Providing
Systems Development and Engineering and Technical Direction, through 9.505-4,
Obtaining Access to Proprietary Information. The contractor is responsible for
identifying any actual or potential organizational conflict of interest to the Contracting
Officer that would arise as the result of the issuance of a task order under this contract.
The Contracting Officer will determine on a case-by-case, task order by task order, basis
whether a conflict of interest 1s likely to arise. To avoid or mitigate a potential conflict,
the task order Contracting Officer will impose appropriate constraints, such as the
following:

a. The contractor agrees that if it provides, under a contract or task order, systems
engineering and technical guidance for systems and programs, but does not have
overall contractual responsibility, it will not be allowed to be awarded a contract
or task order to supply the system or any of its major components or be a
subcontractor or consultant to a supplier of the system or any of its major
components (FAR 9.505-1).

b. The contractor agrees that if 1t prepares specifications for non-developmental
items or assists in the preparation of work statements for a system or services
under a contract or task order, it will not be allowed to furnish these items, either
as a prime contractor, a subcontractor or as a consultant (FAR 9.505-2).

c. The contractor agrees that if it gains access to proprietary data of other
companies, it will protect such data and it will not use such proprietary data in
supplying systems or components in future competitive procurements (FAR
9.505-4). In addition, the contractor agrees to protect the proprietary data and
rights of other organizations disclosed to the contractor during performance of
any task order with the same caution that a reasonably prudent contractor would
use to safeguard highly valuable property. The contractor also agrees that if it
gains access to the proprietary information of other companies, it will enter into
an agreement with the other companies to protect their information from
unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and refrain
from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was
furnished.
