The contractor shall effectively educate its employees, through formal training, company
policy, information directives and procedures, in an awareness of the legal provisions of
FAR Subpart 9.5 and its underlying policy and principles so that each employee will

"it" or "1ts") entering into this agreement with the Government; (2) all business
organizations with which it may merge, join or affiliate now or in the future and in any
manner whatsoever, or which hold or may obtain, by purchase or otherwise, direct or
indirect control of it; (3) its parent organization if any and any of its present or future
subsidiaries, associates, affiliates, or holding companies, and; (4) any organization or
enterprise over which it has direct or indirect control now or in the future.

task order contracting officer for the purpose of indicating potential measures to avoid or
mitigate a conflict. In the event the task order contracting officer determines that a
conflict exists which cannot be effectively mitigated the provision in FAR 9.5 must be
followed.

(OCI) mitigation plan be submitted if a perceived or actual OCI exists. Further, all

personnel must receive company sponsored OCI training within 30 days of performing
