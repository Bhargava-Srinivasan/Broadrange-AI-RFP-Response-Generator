SECTION M: EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
M.1 BASIS FOR AWARD

Awards shall be made to responsible offerors whose proposals are determined to be the most
advantageous to the Government, non-price factors and cost/price considered. The Government’s
objective is to obtain the highest quality services considered necessary to achieve program
objectives, with reasonable prices. Award of this contract will be made on a competitive best
value basis, using “tradeoff” procedures between Non-Price and Cost/Price. In evaluating
proposals, non-price factors, when combined, will be considered significantly more important
than price. As proposals become more equal in merit of non-price factors, price/cost becomes
more important. The Government may consider award to other than the lowest priced offerors or
other than the highest technically rated offerors.

Prospective offerors are advised that a proposal meeting the objectives and requirements with the
lowest price may not necessarily be selected if award to a higher priced offer 1s determined to be
most advantageous to the Government:

e All Non-Price factors (Technical Merit, Partnering and Strategic Alliance,
Key Personnel, and Small Business Participation), when combined, will be
considered significantly more important than Cost/Price.

e Factor 1, Technical Merit, is more important than Factor 2, Partnering and
Strategic Alliance.

e Within Factor 1, Technical Merit, the 2 sub-factors are of equal importance.

e Factors 1, 2,3, and 4 will be rated against set standards. If any portion of the
information required in a factor or subfactor 1s not provided, the offeror’s
rating for such factor/subfactor may be adversely affected.

e Factor 1, Technical Merit, will be assigned a rating by rolling up the ratings
assigned to its equally-weighted subfactors, Subfactor A—Technical
Approach, and Subfactor B—Management Approach.

e Factor 3, Key Personnel, will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable
basis. Therefore:

e Failure of an offeror to address the minimum requirements of the Key
Personnel Factor will result in an unacceptable proposal rating, and will
exclude the offeror from receiving an IDIQ award, if not addressed during
negotiations (if any are held).
