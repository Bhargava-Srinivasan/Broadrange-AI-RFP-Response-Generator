## Cybersecurity Support Services 1. Recommended discount rate for calculating present-value cost and benefits response: Based on industry standards and best practices, Broadrange AI recommends a discount rate of 7.5% for calculating present value (PV) costs and benefits. This rate is conservative and takes into account the risk-free rate, long-term market returns, and the time-value-of-money principle.
Here is the text formatted in a professional manner:

**Sources:**

• Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines for calculating present value (PV) for federal tax purposes
• The Standard & Poor's (S&P) 10-year treasury bond yield as a proxy for the risk-free rate
• Historical market returns from institutional investors and economists

**PV Formula:**

PV = Σ (CFt / (1 + r)^t)

**Variables:**

• CFt = cash flow at time t
• r = discount rate (7.5% in this case)
• t = time period (in years)

**Methodology:**

By using a discount rate of 7.5%, we ensure that the present value calculations are conservative and accurately reflect the time-value-of-money principle. This rate allows for a reasonable balance between the costs and benefits of our Cybersecurity Support Services, while also providing a realistic assessment of the project's potential return on investment (ROI).
