furnish fully burdened personnel rates, which include costs for office space and all
normal supplies and services required to support the work. This includes, but is not
limited to, telephones, faxes, copiers, personal computers, postage (to include courier
services such as Federal Express), ordinary business software (e.g., word processing,
spreadsheets, graphics, etc.), normal copying and reproduction costs.

c. Rates offered by contractors shall reflect fully burdened hourly rates for each labor
category (LCAT). The fully burdened labor rates shall include all direct, indirect,
general and administrative costs and profit associated with providing the required
skill. The fully-burdened labor rates shall include all labor and labor-related costs,
such as, but not limited to, the following list of representative labor-related costs:
salaries, wages, bonuses to include stock bonuses, incentive awards, employee stock
options, stock appreciation rights, employee stock ownership plans, employee
insurance, fringe benefits, contributions to pension, other post-retirement benefits,

d. The rates that are set-forth in the IDIQ contract are ceiling rates and cannot be
exceeded on any resultant task order. A contractor may offer multiple ceiling rates for
task orders that have a period of performance that spans across multiple IDIQ years;
however, the subsequent year’s rates shall only take effect when the task order period
of performance crosses into the next IDIQ year. For example, if a task order’s
performance spans across the IDIQ year one and year two, each year’s ceiling rates
will apply for the relevant time periods. The established ceiling rates shall only reflect
services performed within the Continental United States (CONUS). All costs
excluded from the established ceiling rates associated with services performed
Outside the Continental United States (OQCONUS) shall be priced via Other Direct
Costs (ODCs).

e. Inthe event a task order requires services to be performed OCONUS and work is
required for which the contractor can be expected to incur costs specific to OCONUS
performance, such as Defense Base Act Insurance Coverage for OCONUS
contractors, relocation, overseas health care, OCONUS overhead operating costs,
work visas, vehicle lease, OCONUS cell phone card, meals and incidental expenses,
overseas housing allowance, and cost of living allowance, consideration will be given
