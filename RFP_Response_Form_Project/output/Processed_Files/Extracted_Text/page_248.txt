e Factor 4, Small Business Participation, will be evaluated on an
acceptable/unacceptable basis. Therefore:

e Failure of an offeror to address the minimum requirements of the Small
Business Participation Factor will result in an unacceptable proposal rating
and will exclude the offeror from receiving an IDIQ award, if not
addressed during negotiations (if any are held).

The Government anticipates multiple contract awards resulting from this solicitation. This
solicitation is being issued as an unrestricted acquisition; however, a portion of contract awards
will be reserved for small business and 8(a) offerors. These socioeconomic reserve awards will
be made to the best value offeror(s) within each reserve category, 1n accordance with the
evaluation criteria stated in the solicitation.

IDIQ proposals will be separated into three socio-economic groups prior to evaluation of offers.
The three socio-economic groups will be other-than-small businesses, small businesses, and 8(a)
businesses. The Government will reserve IDIQ awards for each socio-economic group, in order
to ensure adequate competition on all task orders. These socioeconomic reserve awards will be
made to the best value offeror(s) within each reserve category, in accordance with the evaluation
criteria stated in the solicitation. The Government intends to award multiple contracts to small
business offerors, and multiple contracts to 8(a) business offerors.

Awards will be made in Group A to the small business offerors, including 8(a) offerors, whose
proposals represent the best value in accordance with the evaluation criteria. Awards will be
made in Group B to the 8(a) offerors whose proposals represent the best value in accordance
with the evaluation criteria. Awards will be made 1n Group C to all offerors whose proposals
represent the best value in accordance with the evaluation criteria (including other-than-small
business offerors who proposals represent the best value, and Group A and Group B awardees).

The Technical Evaluations for proposals in receipt of this solicitation (SP4709-23-R-0001) will
be conducted 1n a two-phased approach; however, an offeror must provide all parts of its
proposal (both Phase | and Phase 2 portions) before the RFP closing date. Offerors will NOT be
given the opportunity to submit further portions of their proposal following Phase | evaluation.
Initial proposals that fail to respond to all Phase 2 factors and subfactors will be rejected as
unacceptable without further consideration.

Proposals will be evaluated in the following two phases:
PHASE 1

1. An offeror’s proposal for Factor 1 (Technical Merit), Subfactor A (Technical Approach) will
be evaluated during Phase 1. Subfactor A (Technical Approach) will receive an Adjectival
rating, as described in Section M.3 below. If an offeror’s Technical Approach proposal fails to
receive an Acceptable or higher rating, the offeror will not advance to Phase 2 of the evaluation
process, and the rest of the offeror’s proposal will not be further evaluated for any of the
remaining Non-Price or Cost/Price factors. As a result, if an offeror does not advance to Phase 2,
they will not be considered eligible for award.
