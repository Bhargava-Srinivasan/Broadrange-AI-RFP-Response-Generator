when it does not meet the terms of the Orders. If a JETS IDIQ Holder does not meet
these requirements, it is the Government’s intent to “off-ramp” the IDIQ Holder by:

(a) Permitting such Contractor’s JETS IDIQ Contract to expire instead of exercising
the Option; or

(b) Implementing a termination for convenience (if applicable and only if such action
is in the Government’s best interest); or

(c) Implementing a termination for default, 1f applicable; or

(d) Taking any other action which may be permitted under the JETS IDIQ Contract’s
terms and conditions.

H.2.2 ON-RAMP

Consistent with FAR 16.504(c)(1)(11)(A), the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) has
determined that it is in the Government’s best interest that at all times during the term of
the Basic Contract, there remain an adequate number of JETS IDIQ Holders eligible to
compete for task orders. Over time, the total number of JETS IDIQ Holders may fluctuate
due to various reasons including industry consolidation, significant changes in the
marketplace or advances in technology, general economic conditions, the Government's
exercise of the off-ramp process, or other reasons. Recognizing this, DLA intends to
periodically review the total number of JETS IDIQ Holders participating in the JETS
Ordering Process and determine whether it would be in the Government’s best interest to
initiate an open season to add new contractors to the JETS Basic Contract.

Open Season Procedures

If DLA determines that it would be in the Government’s best interest to open a new
solicitation to add new IDIQ Holders to JETS, the JETS PCO may do so at any time
provided that:

(a) The solicitation is issued under then-applicable federal procurement law;

(b) The solicitation identifies the total approximate number of new awards that the
JETS PCO intends to make. The JETS PCO may decide to award more or fewer
JETS IDIQ Contracts than the number anticipated in the solicitation depending
upon the overall quality of the offers received;

(c) Any Contractor that meets the eligibility requirements set forth in the new
solicitation may submit a proposal 1n response to the solicitation; however,
existing JETS IDIQ Holders may not hold more than one JETS Basic Contract at
any time;

(d) The award decision under any solicitation is based upon substantially the same
evaluation factors/sub-factors as the original solicitation;

(e) The terms and conditions of any resulting awards from a new solicitation are
materially identical to the existing version of the Basic Contract;
