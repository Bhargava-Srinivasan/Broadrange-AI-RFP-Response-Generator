evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract 1s awarded to this offeror as a result of-or in
connection with-the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate,
use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not

another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets
[insert numbers or other identification of sheets |; and

(2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:

(f) Contract award.

(1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to
the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in
accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.

(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals 1f such action is in the

received.

(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract
without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).
Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or
price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if
the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting
Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range
exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting
Officer may limit the number of proposals 1n the competitive range to the greatest number that
will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
