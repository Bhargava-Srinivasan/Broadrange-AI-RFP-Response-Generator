4. Fly-Away Incident Response

(a) A “Fly Away” Team must be designated of no less than 5 members
to provide On-Site Incident Response capabilities specifically for
cybersecurity incidents. In addition to Incident Response the Fly Away
team will perform basic cybersecurity assessments. Some environments
cannot be accessed for assessment, analysis, mitigation, containment, and
eradication remotely. The Fly-Away team will be activated on an as-
needed basis in support of various initiatives ranging from urgent
situations pertaining to incident response, scheduled visits in support of
operational readiness and preparation, as well as contingencies affecting a
DLA site. The Fly-Away team will be led by a government appointed Fly-
Away Team Lead. The Fly-Away team must be capable of activating
within established time thresholds depending on the urgency of the
situation:

(1) Critical: Depart within 8hrs of notification

(2) Urgent: Depart within 24hrs of notification
(3) Important: Depart within 96hrs of notification
(4) Routine: Depart as soon as possible

(b) Cybersecurity assessments under this subtask include but are not
limited to basic penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and STIG
compliance. These assessments are intended to be preventative measures
for systems that may be targets of cybersecurity attacks. These
assessments will be performed when identified as needed and directed by
the CERT Incident Response branch chief. DLA CERT estimates up to 4
assessments per year may be required.

(c) This team will be required to maintain a software and hardware
Fly-Away kit that 1s portable and capable of performing all functions to
assess, analyze and mitigate a cybersecurity incident locally. These
capabilities include but are not limited to:

(1) Malware analysis/removal
(2) Log Review
(3) Forensic Analysis

(4) Investigation Documentation
