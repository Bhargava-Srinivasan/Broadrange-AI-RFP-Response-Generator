H.4.2 NOTICE OF POTENTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF
INTEREST

a. Notice. The Contracting Officer has determined that this acquisition may
give rise to an organizational conflict of interest (OCI). Accordingly, the
attention of prospective Offerors is invited to FAR Subpart 9.5 --
Organizational Conflicts of Interest. The Contracting Officer shall not
award a contract until the Government determines any conflict of interest
is reasonably resolved. The Contracting Officer has the sole authority to
determine whether an organizational conflict of interest exists and to
determine whether the organizational conflict of interest has been
reasonably resolved. The OCI plan will not be evaluated as part of mission
suitability. However, before being eligible to receive an award, the Offeror
shall submit an acceptable OCI plan (including mitigation plans for any
identified OCIs). As such, the Government may communicate with any
Offeror at any time during the evaluation process concerning its OCI plan.

b. Description of Potential Conflict. The nature of this potential
organizational conflict of interest is the existence of conflicting roles that
might bias a contractor’s judgment or the existence of an unfair
competitive advantage. At this time, no organizational conflict of interest
is identified.

c. Responsibility of Offeror:

1) Applying the principles of FAR Subpart 9.5, each Offeror
shall assess whether there is an organizational conflict of
interest associated with the proposal it submits. The Offeror
must explain the actions it intends to use to resolve any
organizational conflicts of interest it finds in the
Government’s assessment and its own assessment. If its
proposed resolution involves a proposed limitation on
future contracting, the Offeror shall include the limitation
in its proposal. If the proposed resolution involves use of
mitigation techniques, the Offeror shall include the
mitigation techniques in its proposal. Offerors may include
the limitation of future contracting as well as a mitigation
plan when their proposed resolution involves both
techniques to address conflicts.

2) Offerors are encouraged to inform the Contracting Officer

of any potential conflicts of interest, including those
involving contracts with other Government organizations,
