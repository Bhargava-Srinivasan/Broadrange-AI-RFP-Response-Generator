Enterprise Architecture (EA) 1s an explicit description and documentation of the current

and the IT that supports those processes. It also includes a roadmap to migrate the
agency from the current to the target Enterprise Architecture. Enterprise refers to DLA,
recognizing that the agency exists within the larger Department of Defense (DOD) and
Federal enterprises. The DLA EA includes all Agency mission areas, administrative
functions, systems, and technical infrastructure, as well as external interfaces. The DLA
EA 1s comprised of six components of architecture: 1) Business Architecture, 2)
Information and Data Architecture, 3) Applications Architecture, 4) Infrastructure
Architecture, 5) Cybersecurity Architecture, and 6) Technology Services Architecture.
Each component will need to be defined to reflect DLA enterprise current and future
architecture. The defined architecture will need to be documented in architectural
products that comply with the DOD Framework (current version).
