Optimization Forging Advanced Technology), Subsistence Network, and the Emergent
Manufacturing Technologies. In addition, J68 R&D executes the Small Business
Innovative Research (SBIR), Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, and
the Rapid Innovation Fund (RIF).

Contractor personnel supporting this task must be familiar with DLA’s supply chains and
the technology/engineering concepts associated with those supply chains. Secondarily,
the personnel should have experience in R&D program management and related
financial, contract management.

This task is not directly associated with the information technology systems used by DLA
in daily operations because R&D technical projects’ focus is to identify emerging
technologies, to investigate the suitability of these technologies to DLA internal
operations or the Defense Industrial Base, and to mature the technologies to achieve a
low-risk implementation. Completed projects are transitioned into production to be
managed and funded by the sponsor of the technology development, generally one of the
functional directorates (e.g., procurement or technical/quality) or industrial sectors
supporting DLA managed items (e.g., castings or electronics).

The contractor may be required to:

1. Assist the GPM with developing program and financial execution documentation.

2. Assist the GPM with developing program and financial execution exhibits, related
advocacy materials (1.e., presentations).

3. Assist with preparing draft program plans, presentations, and budget documents
for DLA R&D programs. These plans will be drafted per directions from the COR
and the COR will review all recommendations for government approval.

4. Assist the GPM with gathering requirements from DLA stakeholders and capture
and communicate stakeholder needs to the R&D Program office throughout the
program execution cycles.

5. Assist the GPM with strategic assessments of current and emerging of
technologies that have high potential pay back if matured and transitioned into
DLA operations or industrial base.

6. Prepare reports that summarize activities, accomplishments and plans of DLA
R&D programs.

7. Assist in the preparation of Business Case Analyses (BCA) to support decisions
about proposed technological innovations and process improvements. The BCAs
